# Fire-Detection-Surveillance-Camera

## My first Computer Vision project
An automatic algorithm using Python to detect fire from the surveillance cameras which are installed along roadways. A basic deep learning approach was used for the task. 

## Dataset was compiled by me and contains over 10,000 images. [Link to Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tharakan684/urecamain){:target="_blank"}
- Synthetically generated images and images scrapped off the web
- Exact distribution of images can be found in the research report and the readme in the dataset folder.
