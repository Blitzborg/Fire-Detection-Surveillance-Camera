# Fire-Detection-Surveillance-Camera
## My first Computer Vision project
An automatic algorithm using Python to detect fire from the surveillance cameras which are installed along roadways. A basic deep learning approach was used for the task. 

## Dataset was compiled by me and contains over 10,000 images. [(https://www.kaggle.com/tharakan684/urecamain)]
