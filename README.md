# Fire-Detection-Surveillance-Camera
## My first Computer Vision project
An automatic algorithm using Python to detect fire from the surveillance cameras which are installed along roadways.
Dataset was compiled by me and contains over 10,000 images.
Test accuracy -> 93.8%
Validation accuracy -> 95.3%
Train accuracy -> 100%
